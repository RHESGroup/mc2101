#This command reads all output products associated with the IP core, including the design checkpoint file (DCP), into the in-memory design
#This allows you to reuse the previously synthesized IP without needing to regenerate it, which can save time and resources
# Vivado will check the cache directory for the IP core. 
#If the IP core is found in the cache and hasnâ€™t changed, it will use the cached version instead of re-synthesizing it
#Vivado automatically checks if there have been any changes to the IP core. If there are no changes, it uses the cached version. 
#If there are changes, it will re-synthesize the IP core and update the cache
